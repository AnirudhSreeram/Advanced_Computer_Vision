# Advanced_Computer_Vision
This Repo contains implementation of various classical Image processing algorithms and Computer vision based algorithms that are used to perform 
Image classification and detection.

1. Selective search algorithm with colour strategy and combination of various other strategy is implemented.
2. SIFT algorithm with eucledian distance for matching is implemented.
